        Transcriptomic analyses of bacteria have become instrumental to our understanding of their responses to changes in their environment. While traditional analyses have been informative, leveraging these datasets within genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions can provide greatly improved context for shifts in pathway utilization and downstream/upstream ramifications for changes in metabolic regulation. Previous techniques for transcript integration have focused on creating maximum consensus with the input datasets. However, these approaches have collectively performed poorly for metabolic predictions even compared to transcript-agnostic approaches of flux minimization that identifies the most efficient patterns of metabolism given certain growth constraints. Our new method, RIPTiDe, combines these concepts and utilizes overall minimization of flux in conjunction with transcriptomic analysis to identify the most energy efficient pathways to achieve growth that include more highly transcribed enzymes. RIPTiDe requires a low level of manual intervention which leads to reduced bias in predictions.
