# RIPTiDe

**R**eaction **I**nclusion by **P**arsimony and **T**ranscript **D**istribution

v3.4.18
----

Transcriptomic analyses of bacteria have become instrumental to our understanding of their responses to changes in their environment. While traditional analyses have been informative, leveraging these datasets within genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) can provide greatly improved context for shifts in pathway utilization and downstream/upstream ramifications for changes in metabolic regulation. Many previous techniques for GENRE transcript integration have focused on creating maximum consensus with input datasets, but these approaches have been shown to generate less accurate metabolic predictions than a transcript-agnostic method of flux minimization (pFBA), which identifies the most efficient/economic patterns of metabolism given certain growth constraints. Despite this success, growth conditions are not always easily quantifiable and highlights the need for novel platforms that build from these findings. This method, known as RIPTiDe, combines these concepts and utilizes overall minimization of flux weighted by transcriptomic analysis to identify the most energy efficient pathways to achieve growth that include more highly transcribed enzymes, without previous insight into extracellular conditions. This platform could be important for revealing context-specific bacterial phenotypes in line with governing principles of adaptive evolution, that drive disease manifestation or interactions between microbes.

## Usage

**Comments before starting:** 
- Make sure that genes in the transcriptome file matches those that are in your model.
- Check the example files for proper data formatting
- Binning genes into discrete thresholds for coefficient assignment is available in riptide.read_transcription_file() (not recommended)
- Opening the majority of exchange reactions (bounds = +/- 1000) may yeild better prediction when extracellular conditions are unknown
- The resulting RIPTiDe object has multiple properties including the context-specific model and flux analyses, accessing each is described below

```python
import riptide

my_model = cobra.io.read_sbml_model('tests/genre.sbml')

transcript_abundances_1 = riptide.read_transcription_file('tests/transcriptome1.tsv')
transcript_abundances_2 = riptide.read_transcription_file('tests/transcriptome2.tsv') # has replicates

riptide_object_1_a = riptide.contextualize(model=my_model, transcriptome=transcript_abundances_1)
riptide_object_1_b = riptide.contextualize(model=my_model, transcriptome=transcript_abundances_1, tasks=['rxn1'], exclude=['rxn2','rxn3'])

riptide.save_output(riptide_obj=riptide_object_1_a, path='~/Desktop/example_riptide_output')
```

```

In the final step, RIPTiDe assesses the fit of transcriptomic data for the calculated network activity through correlation of transcript abundance and median flux value for each corresponding reaction. The Spearman correlation coefficient and associated p-value are the reported following the fraction of network topology that is pruned during the flux minimization step.

Max fit RIPTiDe tests all minimum objective flux fractions over the provided range and returns only the model with the best Spearman correlation between context-specific flux for reactions and the associated transcriptomic values. Note, terminating search if a subsequent iteration has a lower correlation coefficient than the last could result from a local maxima and must be considered if an exhaustive analysis is preferred.
